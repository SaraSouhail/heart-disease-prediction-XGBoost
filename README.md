# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using XGBoost

## 📘 Description
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using **Machine Learning** techniques, specifically the **XGBoost** algorithm.  
It was developed as part of my Master’s in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📊 Objective
To analyze patient health data and build a predictive model that can identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Data preprocessing and feature selection  
2. Model training with XGBoost  
3. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
4. Visualization of important features

## 📈 Results
Achieved a strong predictive performance with high accuracy on the test set.  
Visualizations show key factors influencing heart disease risk.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction-xgboost.git
